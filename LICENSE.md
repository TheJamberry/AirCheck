# AirCheck

AirCheck is a Linux-based broadcast confidence monitoring tool that compares live program audio against off-air FM audio to verify transmission integrity in real time.

Designed primarily for community and independent broadcasters, AirCheck helps confirm that what is being transmitted over FM matches the source audio being sent to the transmitter.
